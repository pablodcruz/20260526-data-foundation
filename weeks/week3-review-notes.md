# Week 3 Review

# SQL

## Intro to SQL
- Database: A tool that allows us to input, manage, organize, store, and retrieve data
    - Traditionally databases are organized into tables in the form of rows and columns
    - The goal of any database is to persist information
- SQL (Structured Query Language)
    - SQL is a standard for how to construct a RDBMS (Relational Database Management System)
        - RDBMS: A system for creating relational databases and interacting with them
            - RDBMS provide and maintain security, accuracy, integrity, and consistency of data
        - Relational database: databases that are used to store information where tables will have connections/references/relationships with each other
- SQL Dialects
    - SQL is a language standard, but not a direct implementation of a particular language
    - Dialects are actual implementations of the SQL standard
    - Each dialect has slightly different syntax, keywords, conventions, etc. based on its own implementation
    - Examples
        - PostgreSQL
        - Firebird
        - IBM Db2
        - MS SQL
        - MySQL
        - MariaDB
        - etc.
    - We are using Postgres becuase it is powerful, convenient, and FREE

## SQL Sublanguages
- Data Definition Language
    - Defines the overall structures and is concerned with the creation, alteration, and deletion of structures
        - Structures include: The database itself, tables, schemas, etc.
        - Schemas: term has two slightly different meanings depending on context
            - Conceptual context: A description of the structures that make up the database
            - DDL context: a subdivision of a database that collects tables into the same "area" of the database
                - Analogous to Java packages containing Classes
    - DDL Commands
        - CREATE: This is used to create a table or other database structures
        - ALTER: Changes an existing database structure such as adding a clumn to a table
        - DROP: Removes a database structure
        - TRUNCATE: Removes all data from a structure, generally a table, but leaves the structure itself
- Data Manipulation Language (DML)
    - This is about handling data inside the tables
    - These are often referred to as SQL's CRUD functionalities
        - CRUD: Create, Read, Update, Delete
    - DML Commands
        - INSERT: adds a new record to a table
        - SELECT: reads information from a table without changing it (used for data retrieval, often known as "queries")
        - UPDATE: changes the value of data already present in the database
        - DELETE: removes a row/record or multiple rows/records at once, possible to use DELETE to achieve same functionality as TRUNCATE, but not recommended
- Data Query Language (DQL)
    - This is a highly debated sublanguage
    - Some schools of thought say that DQL is a separate sublanguage from DML
    - Others say it doesn't exist
    - Or some classify it as a sub-sublanguage
    - Command: SELECT (see SELECT in DML above)
- Data Control Language (DCL)
    - Security functionality for who and what can access your data with what permissions. It usually revolves around users, granting users access to just querying (read-only access), while others can use all DML statements but no DDL, etc.
    - Commands: GRANT, REVOKE
- Transaction Control Language (TCL)
    - Represents control over the functionality for transactions. A transaction is a group of DML commands that need to either all run or all fail together
    - Commands:
        - COMMIT: will end a transaction after ensuring all changes can be made successfully
        - SAVEPOINT: sets the state of the database we will return to if a following command should fail. When we START or BEGIN a transaction, the savepoint is automatically set
        - ROLLBACK: aborts transaction returning to a savepoint
        - START/BEGIN: dialect dependent. Indicates the following commands are part of a transaction and sets the initial SAVEPOINT

## Postgres Datatypes
- Datatypes are consistent between SQL dialects
- Most dialects will have datatypes that hold similar values, but might be named DIFFERENTLY
- Datatypes are constraints placed on a column
- Postgres Common Datatypes
    - BOOLEAN: allowed to be null/empty as well as true/false
    - VARCHAR(x): Variable number of characters like Strings in Java. X is the maximum number of characters allowed
    - INTEGER: Whole number integer values
    - NUMERIC(x, y): Floating point numbers, "x" is the precision which represents the number of digits allowed. "y" is the scale which represent how many of those digits come after the decimal
    - DATE: Calendar Date
    - TIMESTAMP: Price moment in time

## SQL Constraints
- Constraints are rules or conditions that enforce consistency on the values of a column. They also can be used to define relationships between tables. They can be attached to a single column or multiple columns
- Examples:
    - UNIQUE: no duplicate values in the column
        - NULLS are not counted
    - NOT NULL: a column that cannot have a NULL value. When inserting a new record, the column must be filled or the INSERT statement will fail
    - CHECK: this allows for a logical check that can be defined to further constrain the column. You can CHECK a column is never less than 0, to ensure no negative values, for example
    - PRIMARY KEY (PK): Combines the UNIQUE and NOT NULL to ensure this value is unique to each record in the table and thus every record can be individually accessed/referenced in that table
        - The PK is used to serve as a unique identifier for a record
    - FOREIGN KEY (FK): Indicates a column in one table references a value in another table. This is how relationships are created between tables
        - Postgres uses REFERENCES to establish FKs
- Additional key concepts:
    - UNIQUE KEY: A key (single column or combination) that provides a unique constraint but is not the primary key.
    - SECONDARY / ALTERNATE KEY: A candidate key that is not chosen to be the primary key, but can still uniquely identify a row.

## Cardinality/Multiplicity
- 3 types of multiplicity
    - 1:1 (one to one)
        - An individual record in one table is associated with a single record in another table
        - UNIQUE FK column
        - The FK can be on either table
    - 1:n (one to many) / n:1 (many to one)
        - An individual record in one table can be referenced by multiple records in another table
        - Achieved by having a FK column that is not-unique in the "many" table
        - ex. User table, Reimbursements table
            - A user can have many reimbursements
            - Reimbursement table will have a FK column to refer to the user each reimbursement belongs to
    - n:n (many to many)
        - An individual record may be associated with many records in another table, and records in that table may be associated with many records in the first table
        - The use of a third table, called a junction table, can be used to establish the many to many relationship

## Data Modeling & ERD
- ER diagrams (Entity-Relationship Diagrams) are visual representations of how data is structured in the database.
- Entities: real-world concepts or objects represented as tables (e.g., Users, Orders, Products).
- Attributes: the properties of entities, represented as columns in a table (e.g., user_id, first_name, email).
- Relationships: how entities relate to one another (1:1, 1:n, n:n).
- Crow’s foot notation: a common diagram style that visually represents relationship multiplicity (one vs many).

## SQL Joins
- When creating a query (SELECT statement), you can combine multiple tables based on a logical relationship between columns. The majority of the time it is a FK to PK relationship
- Joins create a temporary table that displays information requested across tables
- Join Types
    - INNER JOIN: selects records to display only if there is matching data from both tables
    - LEFT JOIN: The first table will display all records and any matching data from the right table will be displayed. IF a record has no relation from the left table, the right table will appear as null
    - RIGHT JOIN: Same as left but reverses the tables
    - OUTER JOIN (FULL): Shows all records from both tables, combining where there is a relationship
    - SELF JOINs: a table can be joined with itself. Ex. employees table may have a FK to the employee's boss id
    - CROSS JOIN: returns the Cartesian product of two tables (every row on the left with every row on the right)
    - EQUI JOIN: a join where the join condition uses the equality operator (=)
    - THETA JOIN: a join where the join condition uses any comparison operator (such as <, >, <=, >=, !=)

## SQL Subqueries
- Subqueries are queries made inside other queries. Since a SELECT statement returns a temporary table, you can then run an additional query on the returned temporary table
- In order to avoid ambiguity in these types of situations, "aliases" are often used
    - Alias: a temporary name assigned to a table to easily identify the table (uses the AS keyword)

## SQL Set Operations
- These are ways to manipulate the temporary tables returned by a query statement
- They do not make changes to the underlying data
- Commands
    - ORDER BY: sorts the returned records based on the values in a column or columns
        - ASC (ascending) or DESC (descending) are built in functionalities to determine the order in which the data is presented
    - GROUP BY: take data in the table and group the values that are having an aggregate function performed on them; the function then returns for that group or that subsection of the table instead of the whole table
        - HAVING: is used with GROUP BY to determine the condition that defines the groups
    - UNION: will stack tables together. Will match tables with the same number of columns into a single table, putting records from both into that single table

## SQL Scalar and Aggregate Functions
- Pre-built functions in an SQL dialect. All SQL dialects will have at least some of these built in
- Some dialects will have the ability to create custom functions in a programmatic expansion to SQL (Postgres has PLpg/SQL), which are different than the functions we are talking about
- Scalar Functions
    - These are functions that act on each record in a table and return a value for them individually
    - Thus, we can say they return a value for each record
    - Examples
        - UPPER(): makes VARCHAR all uppercase
        - LOWER(): makes VARCHAR all lowercase
        - FLOOR(): makes a floating number into a whole number by rounding down
        - CEIL(): makes a floating number into a whole number by rounding up
        - ROUND(): rounds a floating number to the nearest integer
- Aggregate Functions
    - These take multiple records and return a single value. These include lots of mathematical functions
        - SUM()
        - AVG()
        - MIN()
        - MAX()
        - COUNT()

## SQL Transaction Properties
- ACID
    - Atomicity: All or nothing, all statements that are part of the transaction must either succeed or fail
    - Consistency: Maintaining relationships between tables (referential integrity) so that there will never be a reference to something that doesn't exist. Also, maintaining the constraints on the data in each column
    - Isolation: Transactions run independent from one another. No transaction should rely on another transaction to function. Isolation is achieved via **isolation levels**
    - Durability: Changes committed to the database by transactions should persist even after the computer is shut down, loses power, etc. since the data should be committed to the disk rather than existing only in temporary random-access memory (RAM)
- Isolation problems
    - Dirty Reads: a transaction reads data that is in the process of being changed by another transaction that eventually reverts
    - Non-repeatable Reads: Data that is read twice during a transaction that ends up reading different values because a second transaction committed a change to that record in the middle of the first transaction
    - Phantom Reads: One transaction is reading a set of records and during that transaction process another transaction commits, changing the number of records involved
- Isolation Levels
    - Read uncommitted: no protection whatsoever
    - Read committed: transactions only read committed data. Protects against dirty reads, but not other problems
    - Repeatable reads: Transactions cannot read data from records in the process of being manipulated by another transaction. Prevents dirty reads + non-repeatable reads
    - Serializable: All data is serialized so only one transaction can access the data even in a group of data at a time. This prevents all problems (dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, phantom reads)
    - SET TRANSACTION allows you to set the isolation level

## Database Normalization
- Normalization is a process of organizing a database with the goal of reducing redundancies
- There are various "normalization forms", which are standards/guidelines on how to organize data
- Normal forms
    - 1NF (1st normal form)
        - Must have a primary key
        - Ensure no repeating groups of data
            - May require creating another table, establishing a relationship with the previous table
    - 2NF (2nd normal form)
        - All columns must be describing the ENTIRE primary key
        - 2NF is already reached if you are in 1NF and you have no composite primary keys
            - composite primary key: a primary key consisting of 2 or more columns instead of 1
    - 3NF (3rd normal form)
        - Columns must ONLY describe the primary key and not other columns in the table
        - We cannot have any column indirectly describing the primary key
        - ex. if we have student_id, zipcode, city
            - city is also describing the zipcode, which means if one were to change, both would need to change (not good)
- Summary
    - You must have a key (and reduce data redundancies): 1st normal form
    - Columns must describe the entire key (composite primary key): 2nd normal form
    - Columns must describe nothing but the primary key (3rd normal form)

## SQL Views
- Views are structures in a database that are essentially **virtual tables**. The virtual tables don't actually store any data, but instead read data from other tables
- Views are essentially queries saved into the database
- Often used when a complex query needs to be consistently accessible
- `CREATE VIEW view_name AS <query>`

## Additional SQL Features
- Sequence: A database object that generates sequential numeric values, often used for surrogate keys or auto-increment behavior.
- Indexes: Structures that improve the speed of data retrieval operations on a table, at the cost of additional writes and storage for maintaining them.

## PL/pgSQL
- PL/pgSQL is a procedural programming language inside of Postgres
    - Includes programming functionalities including loops, conditional statements, etc. to be used with Postgres databases
    - Enables the creation of functions, blocks of reusable code that can manipulate the database and perform other programming functionality
- General SQL concepts related to PL/pgSQL objects:
    - Stored Procedure (general SQL concept): a named, stored block of SQL (and possibly procedural logic) that can be executed as a single unit in the database engine.
    - User-Defined Function (UDF, general SQL concept): a function created by the user in the database that returns a value (or rowset) and can be used in queries or other SQL statements.
- Advantages
    - Works well with SQL
    - Can help scale applications by centralizing processing
- Disadvantages
    - May not be portable to other RDBMSes
    - Can be difficult to manage/learn
- PL/pgSQL can be used to create
    - User defined functions
        - Not to be confused with scalar/aggregate functions that are already built-in
        - Can return a value
        - `CREATE FUNCTION function_name(param1 type, param2 type, ...) RETURNS type LANGUAGE plpgsql AS $$ DECLARE BEGIN END; $$;`
    - Procedure
        - Does not return any value
        - `CREATE PROCEDURE procedure_name(param1 type, param2 type, ...) LANGUAGE plpgsql as $$ BEGIN END; $$;`
- Triggers
    - A trigger invokes a specified function whenever an INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE event occurs
    - Can be specified to run BEFORE or AFTER the event
    - Two types: row and statement level triggers
        - If 20 rows are updated, a row level trigger will run 20 times, while a statement level trigger runs once
    - `CREATE TRIGGER trigger_name <BEFORE or AFTER> <INSERT or UPDATE or DELETE> ON table_name FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE PROCEDURE function_name`
    - `CREATE FUNCTION trigger_function() RETURNS TRIGGER LANGUAGE plpgsql AS $$ BEGIN RETURN NEW END; $$;`
